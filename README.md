# Performing-Packet-Capture-and-Traffic-Analysis

## Objective

In this lab, I will use Wireshark to run a packet capture session, then use common applications to generate traffic on the local area network. I will then use Wiresharkâ€™s analysis capabilities to review the captured traffic at the packet level.
### Skills Learned
- Use Wireshark to capture live network traffic.
- Use Wireshark to analyze captured network traffic.

- Identify critical information associated with each layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack.
- Apply filters to isolate specific types of network traffic.
- Identify differences in the protocol stacks of wired and wireless network traffic.


### Tools and Software Used
- Wireshark
- PuTTY
- FileZilla
- Mininet-WiFi
- Airodump-ng
- Aireplay-ng


### Topology

### Lab Overview
STEP 1 of this lab has two parts, which should be completed in the order specified.
 
- I will run a Wireshark capture session and generate common network traffic.
- I will use Wireshark to analyze the data captured.

STEP 2
- I will use Wireshark in conjunction with the Mininet-WiFi emulator to generate and analyze traffic on a wireless network.
